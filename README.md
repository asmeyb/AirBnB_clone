# <h1 align="center">AirBnB clone The Console</h1>

> HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

This is the first part of a project for Holberton School(ALX(The Room) SE): AirBnB clone - The console. First step: Write a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.

### The command interpreter

The command interpreter is currently capable of:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
